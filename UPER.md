<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* While the basic problem in this project is "create a game using Java" it is more complex than that.
* The biggest challenge will be creating the program in a way that satisfies the core requirements.
* The game I have chosen, Hangman, is a simple game that can be easily created without meeting those requirements and is probably easier to do so that way. I must avoid this.
* Because the game I have chosen to make is much easier than other options like chess, my project needs to be solid.
* I should find ways to make not just Hangman, but a unique version of Hangman.

<h2>2. Planning the Solution</h2>
* Planning the program structure is critical.
* Use a UML diagram to chart out process.
* Look up similar hangman programs for ideas.
* Check if program works.
* Check if program meets core requirements.
* Add additional features.

<h2>3. Executing the Plan</h2>
* Look up guides and similar hangman programs for ideas.
* Decide how to modify the program structure to fit core requirements.
* Design UML diagram.
* Follow diagram to code program.
* Test program.
* Use remaining time to add features.
* See if it's possible to make a GUI.
* Plan presentation.

    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* TBD as process gets further along.
